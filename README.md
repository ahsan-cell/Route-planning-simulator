# Route-planning-simulator
This project is a route planning simulator that utilizes the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between a source and a destination within a network of roads. It provides a user-friendly interface to create road networks, set traffic conditions, specify source and destination points, and visualize the calculated shortest path in real-time.
