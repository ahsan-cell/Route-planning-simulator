# Route-planning-simulator
This project is a route planning simulator that utilizes the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between a source and a destination within a network of roads. It provides a user-friendly interface to create road networks, set traffic conditions, specify source and destination points, and visualize the calculated shortest path in real-time.



## Features

- Interactive road network creation.
- Dynamic adjustment of traffic levels (low and high) on roads.
- Selection of source and destination points by the user.
- Real-time visualization of the calculated path using the A* algorithm.
## Usage

1. Run the simulator:

   ```bash
   python main.py
2. Create a road network by adding roads and specifying their connections.
3. Set traffic levels (low/high) on different roads.
4. Click on the source and destination points on the road network.
5. Click the "Start" button to initiate the A* algorithm.
6. The simulator will visualize the calculated shortest path in real-time.
